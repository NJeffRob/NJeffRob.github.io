title: "New Year's Resolutions and Goals"
---

It is a new year, and as is tradition I thought I would come up with some general goals and resolutions for 2025. I want to focus a bit more on balance this year, especially with my physical and mental health. To that end, I have come up with the following (in no particular order):
- Exercise 5 days a week. I've been going 6 days a week for the past 6 months, and that was too much. Cutting one day should help avoid being too exhausted.
- Cook supper every night. Meal prep is no more! I want to better manage my caloric intake; hopefully cooking will improve that. It'll also give me opportunity to better track my nutrients.
- Perform at one live event. I will have two albums out pretty soon! I should perform.
- Put out a new music project with my friends. I got a drum machine for christmas, and liked it so much I bought a synth to go with it. I want to make some new music this year, and I have some cool ideas for it, so I'm going to.
- Make at least one drawing that I'm happy with, and post it to my art gallery. I don't have much talent for visual art, but I'll be damned if I don't try and make something cool.

That's all I really have planned for personal things this year; I want to look good, feel good, and make cool stuff. I have other professional aspirations as well, but a lot of those rely on others and I should focus on what I can control, not what I can't.

Happy new year to you if you're reading this, and I hope you reach any goals you set for yourself!
