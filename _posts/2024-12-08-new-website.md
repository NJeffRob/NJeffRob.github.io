title: "New and improved personal website!"
---

It has been a while, but I've finally taken the time to update my personal site! This didn't take too long all things considered, I just wasn't willing to make time for this before.

Now that it's done, I'm going to try and update this site over "professional" things, i.e. awards, talks, papers, etc. To satisfy my creativity (and to encourage me to draw more), I've added an ever expanding art gallery page.

Stay tuned for a New Year's post detailing my goals for the upcoming year!
